"""
Real Functionality Tests Package.

This package contains tests that verify actual component behavior,
not just mock interactions. Tests focus on:
- Deterministic logic with real function calls
- State machines with verifiable transitions
- Data transformations with expected outputs

Mock vs Real Strategy:
- Mock: External APIs (Twitter, OpenAI, Supabase, Telegram)
- Real: All internal logic, calculations, state management
